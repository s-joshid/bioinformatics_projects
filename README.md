# bioinformatics_projects
Hi! My name is Dhruvi, I am wrapping up my Masters at Boston University and have set up this repo to showcase some of the projects I have worked on throughout my time there and during past roles. Please refer to the wiki for project descriptions and demos. Feel free to reach out to me at j.dhruvi89@gmail.com. I look forward to connecting with you.
