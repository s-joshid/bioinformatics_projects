Hi! My name is Dhruvi, I am a 2025 Masters of Bioinformatics graduate from Boston University. Currently, I am working as a graduate intern at Dr. Jinying Chen's lab. Here I help identify representative features through ML algorithms, that can be added to the labs current model which predicts risk scores for Alzheimerâ€™s. Previously, I have graduated from the University of Washington with a double major in Bioengineering and Applied & Computational Mathematical Science. Additionally, I had worked with the Armbrust Biological Oceanography Lab with sequencing data to develop a bioinformatic pipeline which identified the transporter proteins expressed in the North Pacific environmental samples, and one that identified upregulated genes in cyanobacteria located in a virus hot spot. I have set up this repo to showcase some of the projects I have worked on throughout my time at BU and during some of my roles. Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/s-joshid/bioinformatics_projects/wiki) for project descriptions and demos. Feel free to reach out to me at j.dhruvi89@gmail.com. I look forward to connecting with you.
